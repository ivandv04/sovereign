Payloads should include the following syntax to be properly registered in the mod NetworkManager:



// FILE START

public record [CLASS NAME]([FIELDS...]) implements CustomPayload {

    public static final Id<[CLASS NAME]> ID = PayloadUtil.createId([PATH]);

    public static final PacketCodec<PacketByteBuf, [CLASS NAME]> CODEC
            = PacketCodec.of([CLASS NAME]::deconstruct, [CLASS NAME]::construct);

    @Override
    public Id<? extends CustomPayload> getId() {
        return ID;
    }

    private static void deconstruct(@NotNull [CLASS NAME] payload, @NotNull PacketByteBuf buf) {
        // deconstruct the class instance into the packet buf
    }

    @Contract("_ -> new")
    private static @NotNull [CLASS NAME] construct(@NotNull PacketByteBuf buf) {
        return new [CLASS NAME]([FIELDS...]);
    }

}

// FILE END



Remember: a PAYLOAD simply covers up the ugly packet buf syntax which was previously needed to send packets over. Now,
you are forced to make this class so that the packet may be sent as a simple Java object which contains built-in packet
buf (de)construction.

MAKE SURE TO REGISTER IN THE NETWORK MANAGER!

A payload is useless without a corresponding packet to actually respond to the data. A payload is a (kind-of) data
structure, not an executable.
